This will guide users on how to deploy the application using Docker, which simplifies the setup process by handling dependencies and configurations through Docker containers. Here's an updated version of the `README.md` with Docker Compose deployment instructions:

# My FastAPI Application with Langchain, Weaviate, and MinIO Integrations

This FastAPI application demonstrates an integrated text processing pipeline using Weaviate and MinIO. It's designed to efficiently process, store, and retrieve documents through a Dockerized environment.

## Features

- Process documents from a MinIO bucket.
- Use OpenAI's LangChain for advanced text processing.
- Index and manage documents in Weaviate.
- Easy deployment with Docker Compose.

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Installation and Deployment

1. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Cdaprod/minio-weaviate-langchain
    cd minio-weaviate-langchain
    ```

2. **Start the Application with Docker Compose**:

    Run the following command to start all services defined in your `docker-compose.yaml`:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up
    ```

    This command will build and start containers for your FastAPI app, Weaviate, and MinIO.

## Proof of Concept

The application showcases the following workflow:

1. **Load Documents from MinIO**: The application retrieves documents stored in a MinIO bucket.

2. **Document Processing**: Documents are processed via LangChain's OpenAI integration.

3. **Indexing in Weaviate**: Processed documents are indexed in Weaviate for full-text search and data retrieval.

4. **API Endpoints**:
    - `POST /process_documents`: Processes and indexes documents from MinIO into Weaviate.
    - `GET /`: Health check endpoint.
    - `POST /index_from_minio`: Indexes documents from MinIO into Weaviate.
    - `POST /query`: Queries documents in Weaviate.
    - `POST /update/{uuid}`: Updates a document in Weaviate.
    - `DELETE /delete/{uuid}`: Deletes a document from Weaviate.

## Example Usage

- **Index Documents from MinIO**:

    ```python
    import requests
    response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/index_from_minio')
    print(response.json())
    ```

- **Query Documents in Weaviate**:

    ```python
    query = '{"query": "your_query_here"}'
    response = requests.post('http://localhost:8000/query', json=query)
    print(response.json())
    ```
